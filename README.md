# Sleep-Efficiency-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
EDA + Data Cleaning on Sleep Efficiency Dataset using Python.
##  Key Visualizations

###  Correlation Heatmap




###  Deep Sleep Percentage vs Sleep Efficiency
Strong positive relationship — higher deep sleep leads to better sleep efficiency.




###  Light Sleep Percentage vs Sleep Efficiency
Strong negative relationship — excessive light sleep reduces overall sleep efficiency.




###  Awakenings vs Sleep Efficiency
More awakenings during the night significantly decrease sleep efficiency.




###  Alcohol Consumption vs Sleep Efficiency
Alcohol consumption negatively impacts sleep efficiency by disturbing deep and REM sleep cycles.
